          <p> Food is my passion. Both eating and cooking. So in the weekends or in the evenings you will find me either having brunch or dinner somewhere or cooking at home. </p>

          <p> Once a year I release my inner German, get the Dirndl out of the closet and meet with my friends for Oktoberfest in München. Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit.<p/>

          <p> Doing sports is my ventile. Lately I explored running for me and did my first "run". Next to that I am a passionate yogi and practise yoga every day. </p>

          <p> I &hearts; travelling. Once a year I take a one month break to go on a long trip. I fell in love with South East Asia after travelling there for 8 months a few years ago. This shot is taken in Sri Lanka. Next destination: Tansania. <p>

          <p> When travelling, you will either find me in the water or under water. I fell in love with both diving and surfing. The beauty of the underwarterworld is undescribable. Also the thrill of riding waves.<p/>

          <p> I &hearts; customers. I &hearts; data. I &hearts; growth.
          <p> I work for OneFit - the Netflix for working out. One membership. No strings attachd. Working out wherever you want, whenever you want. Go check it out here: <a href="https://onefit.nl/nl-nl"> Onefit </a>.</p>
          <p> Within the coming months we want to grow also outside the Netherlands. Fast. That's why we joined the Growth Tribe. </p>

          <p> Well, I know that Piratemetrics have nothing to do with Captain Jack Sparrow. I won't look for an SEO-tree in a forest. And I know that a SCRUM-sprint is not a workout.</p>
          <p>...next to this I have some secret hobbies. Knitting. Solving Japanese puzzles. Oh, and I am obsessed with Winnie Poh. I eat. All. The. Time. </p>
